Looking for maintainers!
------------------------
The original reason for forking this repo and taking on the burden of maintaining it was to support a tool we make called `GModCEFCodecFix <https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/GModCEFCodecFix>`_.

However, we've since migrated that tool to `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/>`_.

We're a small developer with limited resources and manpower, and since we're no longer using this fork in any of our projects, it has become difficult to maintain it.

If you're interested in helping out, `please let us know <contact@solsticegamestudios.com>`_! **PRs are welcome**, active maintainers even more so.

Vagrant
-------

The repo includes a `Vagrantfile` to setup environment for experimentation and development.
We assume you've already have ``vagrant`` and ``virtualbox`` set up.
The VM is ``Ubuntu 16.04`` with all necessary packages installed, and virtualenv for ``python2`` and ``python3``.


.. code:: bash

    vagrant up    # spin the VM and let it setup
    vagrant ssh
    # for python2
    $ source venv2/bin/activate
    # for python3
    $ source venv3/bin/activate



Local Testing
-------------

To run the test suite with the current ``python``, use

.. code:: bash

    make test

To run for specific version, setup a virtual environment

.. code:: bash

    virtualenv -p python3 py3
    source py3/bin/active
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    make test
